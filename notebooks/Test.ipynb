      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year . it showed that you have that low-ish pumping function of your heart at about 45 % . and it also sh- shows some mitral regurgitation , that's that heart murmur that i heard , okay ?\n",
      "[doctor] um , hey , dragon , show me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day , just because your blood pressure's high . and you know , you are retaining a little bit of fluid . i also wan na start you on some lasix , you know , 20 milligrams a day . and have you continue to watch your , your diet , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",

      "[patient] no , i feel the same way .\n",
      "[doctor] okay , all right . and then for your last problem your hypertension , you know , again i , i , i think it's out of control . but we'll see , i think , you know , i'd like to see you take the lisinopril as directed , okay ? uh , i want you to record your blood pressures within the patient , you know , take your blood pressure every day . record them to me for like , about a week , so i have to see if we have to add another agent , okay ? 'cause we need to get that under better control for your heart failure to be more successful , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] do you have any questions ? , and i forgot . for your annual exam , you're due for a mammogram , so we have to schedule for that , as well , okay ?\n",

      "[doctor] yeah . you can certainly take them , you know , all at the same time , as long , as yeah , they're all one scale . you can take them all at the same time . just set an alarm-\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
