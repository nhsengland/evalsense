  The Compression Ratio, also referred to as Word Reduction, is a metric
  commonly used in text summarization to quantify the extent to which a source
  document has been shortened to produce a summary. It is typically calculated
  as the ratio of the length of the summary to the length of the source text.

    {
      "\\text{Compression Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Length of Summary}}{\\text{Length of Source Text}}"
    }
  </LaTeX>

  Lengths can be measured in terms of words, characters, or tokens. A lower
  compression ratio indicates a more concise summary relative to the original
  document. For example, a compression ratio of 0.2 means the summary is 20% of
  the length of the source text.

  While easy to compute and potentially useful for evaluating conciseness, the
  compression ratio on its own does not indicate the overall quality of the
  summary. Typically, the measure should be used alongside more sophisticated
  methods evaluating other aspects of the text, such as correctness and
  readability.
