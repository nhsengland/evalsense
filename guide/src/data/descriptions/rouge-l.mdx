  ROUGE-L (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is an evaluation
  metric that measures the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score)
  based on the [longest common subsequence
  (LCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) of
  words between a reference and a generated text. While it is very fast to
  compute and is still widely used, it relies on surface-level word overlap and
  does not capture deeper semantic meaning. For more comprehensive evaluation,
  consider model-based alternatives such as G-Eval or QAGS Score.

  Example
</Typography>

<Typography variant="body2">

- **Reference text:** The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness and dizziness.
- **Evaluated text:** The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness.
- **Longest common subsequence (LCS):** The patient chest pain shortness of breath lightheadedness
- **LCS precision:**
  - LCS length: 8
  - Evaluated text length: 11
  - LCS precision: <LaTeX>{"\\frac{8}{11} = 0.73"}</LaTeX>
- **LCS recall:**
  - LCS length: 8
  - Reference text length: 12
  - LCS recall: <LaTeX>{"\\frac{8}{12} = 0.66"}</LaTeX>
- **ROUGE-L (F1 score):**
  - ROUGE-L = <LaTeX>{"\\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{LCS precision} \\cdot \\text{LCS recall}}{\\text{LCS precision} + \\text{LCS recall}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 0.73 \\cdot 0.66}{0.73 + 0.66} = 0.69"}</LaTeX>
