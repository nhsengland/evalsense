  Stratified performance evaluation can be used to assess whether a model
  performs consistently across different population subgroups. Instead or
  relying on a single, aggregate performance score, this approach involves
  splitting the evaluation data into smaller segments according to a specific
  characteristic (e.g., gender or ethnicity) and then calculating performance
  metrics separately for each subgoup. This method allows for the identification
  of potential biases, where a model might perform well on average but poorly
  for specific subgroups.

  Evaluation Process

<Typography variant="body2" component="div" gutterBottom>
1. **Subgroup Definition**
    - Identify relevant subgroups based on the considered task, data, intended model usage and potential fairness concerns. These subgroups could be based on key protected attributes or other data characteristics.
1. **Data Segmentation**
    - Divide the evaluation dataset according to the defined subgroups.
1. **Performance Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the model's performance for each subgroup using the chosen evaluation metri(s).
1. **Comparison and Analysis**
    - Compare performance scores across subgroups to identify any substantial disparities. Investigate any observed differences and determine whether the model's performance is at acceptable level for all relevant subgroups.
